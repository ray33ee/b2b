Version 2.1.3
	- Project renamed to b2b

Version 2.1.2
	- Non-error messages are now printed to stdout in JSON format
	- Application now returns meaningful return codes
	- Return codes are properly propagated through function calls

Version 2.1.1
	- Bits per pixel entry in BMP header now calculated from BYTES_PER_PIXEL value
	- Individual string buffers now replaced with global buffer
	- DIB length and Pixmap start entries in header now calculated (instead of magic constants)
	- Conversion from bmp now supports BitmapV5 produced by GIMP.
	- Original header size entry added to BTB header, paving the way for backwards compatibility.
	- Calculations in tobmp based around hard coded sizeof(complete header) size are now based on original header size from BTB header.
	- All preliminary work for backwards compatibility is complete. All that is left is to write truncate/expand code

Version 2.1.0
	- Geany file removed from repo

Version 2.0.6
	- Updated directory structure
	- 'test' function added to makefile
	- Error messages are now sent to stderr

Version 2.0.5
	- Return values of linux commands were being checked incorrectly 
	- Makefile amended to include -lm in linking
	- Created readme
	- Verbosity now decided at compile time via DEBUG preprocessor macro
	- More helpful error message displayed if fopen fails.
	- Updated .gitignore

Version 2.0.4
	- Renaming of files now encapsulated in function
	- Added platform-independent code
	- Using rename function instead of calling move exe
	- Functions now propagate error codes and display error messages

Version 2.0.3
	- Added comments 
	- Completed bitmap checks for bitmap to binary conversion
	- Binary to bitmap now accepts tiny files
	- We now verify read/writes
	- Files are truncated with via windows.h functions, instead of trunc.exe.

Version 2.0.2
	- Size of bmp file and pixmap entries in bitmap header were calculated incorrectly
	- BMP header and BTB headers are now expressed as structures
	- Size-critical values are now declared as uintN_t
	- Magic constants now replaced with nammed variables
	- DEBUG preprocessor directive now added
	- Certain variables renamed for clarity

Version 2.0.1
	- Unused code removed
	- Can deduce conversion based on file extension
	- Options -bin and -bmp removed and option handler updated accordingly

Version 2.0.0
	- Conversion to bmp modifies file instead of creating new one, drastically reducing comptation time
	- Height and width calculated separately, reducing padding size
	- Bitmaps use 32bpp (instead of 24) increasing data density per pixel

Version 1.0.4
	- Files larger than 2^24 bytes would not convert properly, this is fixed (we store the padding size not the original size, which is a smaller number and fits in the 3 bytes of the first pixel)
	- Removed 12MB limit

Version 1.0.3
	- Width and height are now multiples of 4 instead of powers of 2, to save space

Version 1.0.2
	- Command line arguments implemented

Version 1.0.1
	- Bidirectional conversion between binary and bitmap complete

Version 1.0.0
	- Initial commit
	- Conversion from binary file to bitmap complete
