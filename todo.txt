To do list:
	- Add -q argument that engages quiet mode. This will stop user prompts. THis means that if the output file already exists, it will be overwritten.
	- Write truncate code so trunc.exe is not needed with Windows
	- Write code that works for Linux and Windows
	
Ideas and such:

	- The only two platform dependent functions are
		- File truncate - This has a very simple linux implementation, but in windows this is more complex.
		- File renaming - This can be achieved using 'move' in windows and 'mv' on linux.
