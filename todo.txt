To do list:
	- Add -q argument that engages quiet mode. This will stop user prompts. THis means that if the output file already exists, it will be overwritten.
	- Take correct action if binary file is less than 126 bytes
	- Test to make sure input bmp is a valid bitmap
		- Make sure padding value isnt too large
		- Make sure width, height, bpp, pixmap size, bmp and dib header size and actual size all add up.
		- Implement 4-pixel signature and check that too
	- Write truncate code so trunc.exe is not needed with Windows
		- Code for Linux and Windows
	- Implement file_header and bitmap header as structs for easier access?
	- When copying date in file, verify data was copied correctly.
