Version 2.0.3
	- Added comments 
	- Completed bitmap checks for bitmap to binary conversion
	- Binary to bitmap now accepts tiny files
	- We now verify read/writes
	- Files are truncated with via windows.h functions, instead of trunc.exe.

Version 2.0.2
	- Size of bmp file and pixmap entries in bitmap header were calculated incorrectly
	- BMP header and BTB headers are now expressed as structures
	- Size-critical values are now declared as uintN_t
	- Magic constants now replaced with nammed variables
	- DEBUG preprocessor directive now added
	- Certain variables renamed for clarity

Version 2.0.1
	- Unused code removed
	- Can deduce conversion based on file extension
	- Options -bin and -bmp removed and option handler updated accordingly

Version 2.0.0
	- Conversion to bmp modifies file instead of creating new one, drastically reducing comptation time
	- Height and width calculated separately, reducing padding size
	- Bitmaps use 32bpp (instead of 24) increasing data density per pixel

Version 1.0.4
	- Files larger than 2^24 bytes would not convert properly, this is fixed (we store the padding size not the original size, which is a smaller number and fits in the 3 bytes of the first pixel)
	- Removed 12MB limit

Version 1.0.3
	- Width and height are now multiples of 4 instead of powers of 2, to save space

Version 1.0.2
	- Command line arguments implemented

Version 1.0.1
	- Bidirectional conversion between binary and bitmap complete

Version 1.0.0
	- Initial commit
	- Conversion from binary file to bitmap complete
